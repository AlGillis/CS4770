# Game Design Document

## 1. Game Overview

### 1.1. Game Concept / Genre
### 1.2. Game Flow Summary – At a high level, how does the game progress?
### 1.3. Look and Feel – What is the basic look and feel of the game? What is the visual style?
## 2. Gameplay and Mechanics
### 2.1 gameplay
####  2.1.1-the player is greeted by the introduction screen which includes a “login” button , a “play” to start pre-made levels in the game , a “build” button to access the level editor , and an “options” button for configuration
####  2.1.2- the player will move left , right , up or down to reach and complete objectives that in turn help progress the main mission
#### 2.1.3- each level will have mission that includes 1 or more objectives , the level is completed after required objectives are finished.
#### 2.1.4- puzzles can include “ placing blocks  on pressure points to unlock a door” , “ timed jumps to reach certain areas” or “ defeat enemies in a set amount of time”
#### 2.1.5- objectives will depend on the level , they can be “ collect all coins” , “ reach a certain area” , “ complete a puzzle” or “ defeat boss” .
#### 2.1.6- the player progresses through the game by completing the set objectives of the level , the challenge aspect will depend on how the level is made  , it is possible for the player to level up within the level and access more abilities to help complete the level , levels are considered  a full game experience so they are intended to be long so the player can get a sense of progress , and for the levelling system to not be trivial. 
#### 2.1.7- checkpoints will be used  to save progress , unlike quicksave  , checkpoints help us avoid errors that can happen if a player saves at a point in the game where saving is not expected , it also helps the player by not having them return to the game in an inconvenient position and checkpoints also work as an auto-saving system that makes sure the player doesn’t need to remember to save every few minutes.
### 2.2 mechanics
#### 2.2.1- most objects in the game will be ”pulled down by gravity” unless they have a float or fly attribute  , jumps for instance work as a temporary fly  before being pulled down , the player can’t move through walls , except with certain abilities or through transparent walls , the player and NPCs will be able to move through each other.
#### 2.2.2- movement in the game includes moving left or right , jumping or flying up  , and falling down , the player will either be in a running state or a walking state  which determine the speed of movement , movement  in water is slowed down and  movement animation is changed.
#### 2.2.3- there will be multiple interactable object in the game  , interaction will be mostly initiated through hitting the X key , objects can be doors , portals, NPCs with dialogue .
####    Helpful items like power-ups , will have to be picked up by interacting with them and they’ll be stored        in the inventory until used by the user.
#### 2.2.4- actions performed by the player includes movement , interaction and combat , there are also other buttons that will open up the menu , inventory or ability customization.
#### 2.2.5- combat is done through  activating some of the player’s abilities , with the starting ability being a no-cooldown short-range hit  , with the player unlocking more as they progress , enemies  are  harmful themselves (touching them lowers health) they can also fire hostile projectiles  ,  the damage differs depending on the hostile object , reaching 0 health ends the level.
#### 2.2.6- the player collects coins or items throughout the level either by finding them and picking them up or by dropping them from enemies  , they can then sell or buy items in a hub that is usually at the start of the level but can be in different areas, currency drops become less frequent as the player’s wealth increases .
#### 2.2.7- the screen will follow the player throughout the level , the entire level will be one screen with the view focusing on the player and cropping out the rest of the level , transitions will be used when the player activates a portal or a teleport “ability” that requires instance relocation of the view of the screen.
